# Markov-et-al-2019
This repository contains the python scripts that has been used to produce the data published in Markov-et-al-2019.
These scripts are based on [the Stytra library](https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra), and they provide a self-contained description of the behavioral paradigms described in the paper. To test them, you can refer to [the Stytra documentation](http://www.portugueslab.com/stytra/) for software installation and a description of the hardware. These protocols were run using the [0.8.5 Stytra version](https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra/commit/28171789a576f835021d4e0314ac923092aa3acc).
