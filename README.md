# Markov et al 
This repository contains the Python and MATLAB scripts that have been used to produce and analyze the data presented in Markov et al, 2021.

The repo is organized in the following subfolders:
 - stytra_scripts: scripts to run all the behavioral and imaging experiments, based on [the Stytra library](https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra), and they provide a self-contained description of the behavioral paradigms described in the paper. To test them, you can refer to [the Stytra documentation](http://www.portugueslab.com/stytra/) for software installation and a description of the hardware. These protocols were run using the [0.8.5 Stytra version](https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra/commit/28171789a576f835021d4e0314ac923092aa3acc).
 - imaging_preprocessing: python notebooks and scripts to run all the preprocessing of the imaging data, using either the [fimpy library](https://github.com/portugueslab/fimpy) or the [suite2p library](https://suite2p.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
 - behavior_analysis: MATLAB code for analysing the behavioral data;
 - imaging_analysis: MATLAB code for analysing the imaging data
